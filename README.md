# My-Portfolio-W4

Still a wonderfully chaotic work in progress. 
**Chef's kiss**

ToDo List:

// Work on my personal brand logo (at least create a mini one for the top left corner)

// Change button color to match my avatar animation's palette

// Responsive - I want the hero seciton to behave as follows:
    Big screens -> text left aligned
    Small screens -> text aligned center with button group and animation. 
                  -> confirmed all elements align correctly.

// Test and decide - Should I keep the hand-waving emoji, try to make it animated, or remove it alltogether?
